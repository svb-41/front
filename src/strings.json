We made a fully-working training mode, and a perfectly working sandbox. We know you’ll make good use of it.\n\nYou should immediately try to create or use your first AI if you didn’t already. We also have some AI for you, ready to use. Remember, you won’t control your ships directly.\n\nOtherwise, you are awaited on the steering deck of your mothership. You missed your crew during your absence. Oh, and we’ll occasionally send you some message, directly here, in your room. Keep an eye of it. Or maybe you want to be notified directly? Well, our messaging system is broken at that time, but our engineers are working on it. We expect to put it back online in a couple of weeks at most. Covering the entire galaxy is not as easy as pie.",
