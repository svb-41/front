# How-to play?

Hello stranger! I suppose that if you’re here, it’s because you just have been enrolled in the military school! I’m glad to have you here, we’re always in need for newcomers to help leading the development of our nation. Hang tight, we’ll take a look at everything we have to offer.

## Basics

First, the basics. You’re here to lead the war against your ennemies. To do that, you have powerful weapons at will: spaceships. Yes, we’ll provide you real spaceships, as much as we can. And you’ll be able to lead them to win battles.

You’re probably aware of how battles works, but let me explain it one more, in case you don’t. In 2881, we’re not using soldiers anymore in our spaceships, we’re mainly using humanoid drones. They provide a huge advantage over humans: they’re obedient, they follow your orders by the book, and they can die during their mission. Indeed, they are incredibly cheap to build now. You know, the good effects of galaxization. They had globalization in 2022, we have the entire galaxy.

Of course, as you can imagine, we need some rules for them to follow. And for that, we have Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is what powers the drones. You’ll have access to engineers, or you can develop your AI yourself.

And finally, you’ll have some spaceships. Unfortunately they can’t go light-speed and beyond. We don’t have enough luminium to power an entire fleet, and right now, we are prioritizing some other ships. But you have spaceships, with drones, and AI. It should be enough for the moment.

## How to use all of them?

At the beginning of each assignment you’ll have a few things to do: first select your ships. You’ll have some credits, and you’ll have to buy your ships. Try to avoid breaking them. Those things are costly unfortunately. Position your ships on the map. They will mimic it in the space afterwards. Every ship has specific skills and characteristics. Be careful of which you choose.
After that, assign an AI to each of your space. The drones are automatically assigned, according to the ships. Don’t worry about it right now. Each ship should have an AI. Once you’re done with that, you’ll be good to go. Start the mission, and observe the fleet live its life.
